      <p>Satanic Resources is a searchable repository of satanic resources ranging from podcasts and youtube channels to books and movies. Everything in this repository is searchable, either by its tags or by its name and description in the "Keyword Search" field.</p>
      <p>This is the effort of a few hard-working individual Satanists. While we each belong to separate Satanic groups, this repository is by no means associated with any larger satanic organisation nor group.</p>
      <p>We do our best to make sure the information on this site is up to date and accurate, but if you notice an inaccuracy, please email me at <a href="mailto:leon.bael6@gmail.com?subject=Satanic%20Resources">leon.bael6@gmail.com</a> and I will do my best to correct it.
